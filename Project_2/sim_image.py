1.  Compute 3D DFT of molecule mol, producing F(mol) another 3D Array
2.  Restrict F(mol) to the image plane P_f thus producing a 2D Array
2a. Interpolation buisness that I don't quite understand how to code up

Questions:

What type of Discrete Fourier Transform of mol are we computing?
Since we are given a 3D array mol I am pretty sure we are computing
3 dimenstional fourier transform so I looked at:
