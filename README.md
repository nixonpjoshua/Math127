The PDF reports provide a good description of our work

Project 1 is on phylogentic inference primarily with the neighbor joining and UPGMA algorithms using the Jukes-Cantor distance and exploring the Kimura model
  written in python and jupyter notebook

Project 2 is exploring Cryo-EM, simulation of Cryo-EM images and back projection using those images to reconstruct the origonal distribution using the Fourier transform, we used the Zika virus to test our code
  written in python
